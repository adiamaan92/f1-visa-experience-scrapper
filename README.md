# F1 Interview Experience Scrapper

## Context
F1-Visa is a type of non-immigrant visa provided by the US Government to allow students to temporarily live in the US for a defined period of time while studying at a school. It is the 3rd most applied visa in the whole world. For many students, it is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication.

After appearing for TOEFL/IELTS, GRE and applying for schools of interest, and getting an admit, attending the Visa Interview is the next step, which arguably is also the toughest. It is a subjective process, where a Visa officer asks a serious of question to the prospective student and arrives at a conclusion deeming his fitness.

An example for the denial could be,

1. Signs of family ties already present in the US (makes a student highly unlikely to return back to home country)
2. Lack of funds for education
3. No ties between experience and the major chosen
4. Questionable universities and academic performances

The data comes from a telegram channel and all the visa experiences mainly are from India. I am working on adding more sources. So watch out!
